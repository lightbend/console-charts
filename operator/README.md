# Console Operator

This directory provides files to install the Console Operator. To install, use the kustomization.yaml file:

``` sh
kubectl apply -k .
```

This will set up the Console operator.

## Directory Structure

- [kustomization.yaml](kustomization.yaml) is the resource used to install the operator.
- [manifests](manifests) is automatically generated by the operator-sdk kit, packaging up our helm chart into an
  operator. Files in here should not be modified manually.
- [src](src) contains customizations on top of the operator-sdk generated files.
