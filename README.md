# helm-charts

Contains public Helm charts for various Lightbend projects. This project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://lightbend.github.io/helm-charts/index.yaml).

## Setup

```bash
helm init
helm repo add lightbend-helm-charts https://lightbend.github.io/helm-charts
helm update
```

## Installation

Refer to the documentation for installation instructions.

## Publishing Charts

Make any changes to the chart, commit it and open a PR. Once the change is merged to master,
you can release it directly:

    scripts/make-release.sh <version> <chart-name>
    git push --tags
    
For example:

    scripts/make-release.sh 0.0.15 enterprise-suite
    git push --tags

This will set the chart version, package it, and make a
commit. Finally, `git push --tags` will publish the release and git tag.

## Development

A `Makefile` is provided with useful targets for development.

* `make` to check the chart for errors, and update `docs` and `resources`.
* `make install-local` to try the release in docs.
* `make lint` if you just want to check for errors.

To specify the chart to build, set the `CHART` variable:

    make CHART=reactive-suite
    make CHART=enterprise-suite
    
By default `CHART=enterprise-suite`.
