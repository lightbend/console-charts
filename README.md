[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lightbend/helm-charts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lightbend/helm-charts)

# helm-charts

Contains public Helm charts for various Lightbend projects. The helm repo is available at `https://repo.lightbend.com/helm-charts`.

## Project layout

All projects must conform to the [Helm chart layout](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/).

If there are files that you don't want included in the chart, add them to a `.helmignore` file in your project directory.

## Project Makefile

All projects must have a `Makefile` that implements the targets:

- `lint`:  Should do preliminary checks to confirm the project is ready for packaging.
- `package`:  Should create the chart tarball and push it up to the `helm-charts/docs` directory.
- `test`:  Typically run by Travis to test the release.

A default `common.mk` file is included that can be used for this purpose, although a project is free to implement these targets as they see fit.

## Helm-charts Makefile

The default target of the top-level Makefile packages all the charts
and then builds the `index.yaml` file based on the tarballs.

If any of the `lint`, `package`, or `test` targets are invoked, they are recursively invoked on each of the projects.  To run over a particular subset of projects just define a value on the command line.  e.g. `make package CHARTS=sample-project`

## Helm install a project:

To install the Helm chart for a particular project...

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller

kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller

helm init --service-account tiller

helm repo add lightbend-helm-charts https://repo.lightbend.com/helm-charts

helm repo update

helm install lightbend-helm-charts/<chart-name> --name=<release-name> --namespace=lightbend --debug
```

### Upgrade

```
helm repo update
helm upgrade lightbend-helm-charts/<chart-name> --name=<release-name> --namespace=lightbend --debug
```

## Cutting a Release / Publishing Charts

### Release Charts

Install [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) if you don't have it yet:

    go get github.com/mikefarah/yq
    # or
    brew install yq                  

Make sure you've done any required changes to your project, including to the `values.yaml` file.

Then run the release script on a clean master checkout.  (Make sure you're in a clean master checkout and not your
working copy as stray files could end up in the tarball.  You may need to `git clone git@github.com:lightbend/helm-charts.git` the repo into a fresh directory.)

    scripts/make-release.sh enterprise-suite
    # Check that things look right at this point.  See below...
	git push --follow-tags
    
The `make-release.sh` script will create the chart tarball in the `docs`
directory, rebuild the `index.yaml` file, make
commits and generate a tag for the release. _This is the point to do a quick sanity check on things._  (For
example, check the size of, and files in, the new tarball.) If things look wrong, you can do a `git reset --hard HEAD~2` and start over.  (You'll have to delete the generated tag as well.  `git tag -d blah`)

By default, the build uses the version specified in the `Chart.yaml`
file. Optionally, you can specify the version to use:

    scripts/make-release.sh enterprise-suite 1.0.0

This is useful if you want to increment the major or minor version
number.  Either way, the patch component of the version number will be auto-incremented for the next build.
In the example above, the build would use v1.0.0 and `Chart.yaml` would then
be setup for the next build with version 1.0.1.  (The modified `Chart.yaml` is committed on its own after the commit (and tag) for the release.)

Finally, `git push --follow-tags` will push the changes (including tag) to the upstream master branch.  This will kick off a build job to publish the release to the public helm repo. You can confirm things are published with

    helm repo update
    helm search enterprise-suite
